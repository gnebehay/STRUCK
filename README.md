STRUCK: Structured Output Tracking with Kernels
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRUCK is part of the [Visual Object Tracking Repository](https://github.com/gnebehay/VOTR),
which aims at providing a central repository for state-of-the-art tracking algorithms that are freely available.
The source code for this tracker was obtained from its [project website](http://www.samhare.net/research/struck/code)
and extended by a challenge mode.
The following description was copied literally from the original author.
